#Logic Puzzle Project#
##Overview##
Logic Puzzles are brain teasers that require you to use the process of elimination in order to come up with the correct solution. For example, if the clue states "person x is not in occupation y", you would place an "X" at the coordinates where x and y intersect on the grid. Use the clues to solve the puzzle!

##Project Notes##

I have always loved doing logic puzzles and the logic involved in creating a dynamic puzzle of my own was a fun and challenging opportunity. The most difficult aspect of this project was probably the work involved in styling the grid and the labeling tables and making them stay aligned while the board is manipulated.

##Technologies Used##

-HTML/CSS/jQuery
-Google Fonts
-Github


##Rough Drafts##


##Future Developments##

-Implement 'show mistakes' button that flashes the background red on any grid squares filled out incorrectly
-Further work on styling to make the page reactive to mobile/resizing
-Implement function that will place "X"s automatically on all other squares in the row/column with an "O".
-Create separate page that explains the logic step by step
